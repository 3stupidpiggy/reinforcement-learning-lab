# Environment
## state space: 6
(fx-x, fy-y, left, right, up ,down)
(x, y) is the position of the snake head. 
(fx, fy) is the position of the food.    
left indicates whether the left side of the snake’s head is a boundary or part of the snake’s body. left can only be 0 or 1. 
...

## action space: 4
The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
